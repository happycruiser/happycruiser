      <p><b>Cruising with kids is one of the easiest ways for Aussie families to enjoy a fun, stress-free holiday. From kids’ clubs to waterslides, cruises are packed with family-friendly features—but a little planning goes a long way. Here’s everything you need to know to make your family cruise smooth sailing.</b></p>
      
      <h2>Pack Smart and Light</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Bring swimmers, sun hats, and plenty of sunscreen</li>
        <li>Comfortable walking shoes for shore excursions</li>
        <li>Favourite snacks, especially for little ones</li>
        <li>Books, tablets, and travel games for downtime</li>
        <li>Light jumpers—it can get cool at sea, even in summer</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Don’t overpack—there are laundries onboard and you’ll spend most of your time in casual wear.</p>

      <h2>Check In to the Kids’ Club Early</h2>
      <p>
        Sign up for the kids’ club on embarkation day—spots fill quickly! Carnival’s Camp Ocean and Royal Caribbean’s Adventure Ocean are top rated by Aussie families. Kids make friends instantly, and the staff organise awesome activities.
      </p>

      <h2>Set a Simple Routine</h2>
      <p>
        Most families find it helps to set a “meet up” point and basic routine (like family breakfast or dinner together). This gives everyone freedom, but you won’t lose track of the kids!
      </p>

      <h2>Embrace Onboard Activities</h2>
      <p>
        Try everything: mini-golf, waterslides, scavenger hunts, movies under the stars, dance parties, cooking classes, and arts & crafts. Don’t forget the family game shows and themed nights!
      </p>

      <h2>Dining with Kids</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Buffet and pizza bars are open most of the day</li>
        <li>Main dining rooms offer kids’ menus and fast service</li>
        <li>Most lines cater for allergies—just ask your waiter</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Many families bring a small supply of favourite snacks
